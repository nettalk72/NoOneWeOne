      Prologue. The Standards Were Not Born in the Future
    </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      — Why, in the Age of AI, We Are Called Back to the Past
    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We often say things like this:</p>

    <p>“This is a completely new era.”</p>
    <p>“AI is a change humanity has never experienced before.”</p>

    <p>But if we take a step back,</p>
    <p>this statement is only half true.</p>

    <p>The technology is new.</p>
    <p>But the experience of losing our standards is not.</p>

    <h2>Whenever standards collapse, humanity asks the same question</h2>

    <p>Looking back at history,</p>
    <p>moments when standards fell apart</p>
    <p>always looked strangely similar.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When myths lost their power to explain the world</li>
      <li>When religion could no longer provide absolute answers</li>
      <li>When kings and institutions began to be questioned</li>
      <li>When science redefined reality itself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each time, people began to ask:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Then what should we live by now?”
    </em></p>

    <p>The anxiety of the AI era</p>
    <p>is simply the latest version</p>
    <p>of this ancient question.</p>

    <h2>AI is not the beginning of standards — it is their accelerator</h2>

    <p>AI may feel like the first force</p>
    <p>to threaten human judgment.</p>

    <p>But what AI actually did was simpler:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It made existing standards invisible</li>
      <li>And made them operate far faster</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We didn’t lose our standards.</p>
    <p>We handed them over.</p>

    <h2>Why we return to the past</h2>

    <p>This is why this series</p>
    <p>calls back saints, philosophers, and artists.</p>

    <p>Not because they “had the right answers,”</p>
    <p>but because they all lived through eras</p>
    <p>where standards had collapsed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They doubted what the majority believed was right</li>
      <li>They lived when existing orders no longer worked</li>
      <li>They faced times when no one could decide for them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They had to set their own standards.</p>

    <p>It looks remarkably like our time.</p>
    <p>So similar that it deserves to be reread.</p>

    <h2>What they left behind</h2>

    <p>The figures we will examine in this series</p>
    <p>share one common trait.</p>

    <p>They did not leave answers.</p>
    <p>They left standards.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What questions must be asked first</li>
      <li>What should not be believed too easily</li>
      <li>What must never be abandoned, no matter the cost</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is why their names</p>
    <p>are called back</p>
    <p>whenever an era changes.</p>

    <h2>What it means to read the past in the age of AI</h2>

    <p>This series is not an attempt</p>
    <p>to romanticize the past.</p>

    <p>Nor is it a rejection of AI.</p>

    <p>It is an attempt to revisit</p>
    <p>the original ways humans created standards,</p>
    <p>in order to live through the AI era.</p>

    <p>The more technology tries to become the standard,</p>
    <p>the more we must look back</p>
    <p>at moments when humans themselves created one.</p>

    <h2>How this series hopes to be read</h2>

    <p>Not like this:</p>

    <p>“That person was amazing.” ❌</p>
    <p>“So what am I supposed to do now?” ❌</p>

    <p>But instead, leaving this question behind:</p>

    <p><em>
      “If I were in that situation,<br />
      what would I have chosen as my standard?”
    </em></p>

    <p>If that question remains,</p>
    <p>this series has already done its job.</p>

    <h2>Where the connections meet</h2>

    <p>The AI series asked</p>
    <p>how future standards are created.</p>

    <p>This series looks back</p>
    <p>at how standards were created in the past.</p>

    <p>And the two questions meet at one conclusion:</p>

    <p><strong>
      Standards have never begun with technology,<br />
      but with human attitude.
    </strong></p>

    <p>History moves in cycles.</p>
    <p>And the way standards are created</p>
    <p>repeats itself with surprising consistency.</p>

    <p>Now,</p>
    <p>let’s step into</p>
    <p>the original pattern of that repetition.</p>

    <h1 id="series-4-1-title">
      Episode 1. Why Do Some Ideas Remain Standards Even After 2,000 Years?
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Every era produces countless ideas.</p>

    <p>Most disappear.</p>
    <p>Some survive in textbooks.</p>
    <p>And only a very small few become standards.</p>

    <p>We often say:</p>

    <p>“That’s an old way of thinking.”</p>

    <p>And yet, something feels strange.</p>

    <p>Philosophy from 2,000 years ago is still quoted.</p>
    <p>Art created centuries ago is still called “classic.”</p>
    <p>The ways of thinking of people long dead</p>
    <p>are still used to explain judgments today.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <h2>What long-lasting ideas have in common</h2>

    <p>Ideas that remain as standards</p>
    <p>share one clear trait.</p>

    <p>They did not try to explain their era.</p>

    <p>Instead,</p>
    <p>they touched the way humans judge.</p>

    <p>They did not leave answers to</p>
    <p>“What is right,”</p>
    <p>but to</p>
    <p><strong>“How do we decide what is right?”</strong></p>

    <p>That is why,</p>
    <p>even when eras change,</p>
    <p>they can be taken out and used again.</p>

    <p>A standard is not an answer.</p>
    <p>It is a framework for thinking.</p>

    <h2>The difference between trends and standards</h2>

    <p>Trends respond to the problems of their time.</p>

    <p>Current anxieties.</p>
    <p>Current technologies.</p>
    <p>Current conflicts.</p>

    <p>That is why they are consumed quickly</p>
    <p>and disappear just as fast.</p>

    <p>Standards are different.</p>

    <p>They are reused when anxiety repeats.</p>
    <p>They are recalled when conflict arises.</p>
    <p>They are summoned when judgment wavers.</p>

    <p>A standard is an idea</p>
    <p>that remains usable</p>
    <p>even when the problem changes.</p>

    <h2>When are standards created?</h2>

    <p>Here is something interesting.</p>

    <p>People who created standards</p>
    <p>were rarely figures of stable times.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When existing orders began to shake</li>
      <li>When what the majority believed was questioned</li>
      <li>When the question “What should we believe now?” spread</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In those moments,</p>
    <p>standards were born.</p>

    <p>Standards are not products of calm eras,</p>
    <p>but the result of attitudes</p>
    <p>that endured confusion.</p>

    <h2>What standard-makers refused to do</h2>

    <p>The figures covered in this series</p>
    <p>share another common choice.</p>

    <p>They did not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stand easily with the majority</li>
      <li>Promise immediate solutions</li>
      <li>Try to satisfy everyone</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead,</p>
    <p>they left uncomfortable questions.</p>

    <p>And those questions</p>
    <p>survived across eras.</p>

    <h2>A standard is not a “correct answer,” but a center</h2>

    <p>To create a standard</p>
    <p>is not to give everyone the same answer.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is the opposite.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It provides a center from which individuals can judge</li>
      <li>It prevents thought from collapsing into extremes</li>
      <li>It leaves a coordinate to return to when thinking scatters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is why standards</p>
    <p>do not look like commands.</p>

    <p>They do not say, “Follow me.”</p>
    <p>They simply say, “Return here.”</p>

    <h2>Why reread these people now?</h2>

    <p>In the age of AI,</p>
    <p>we are losing standards again.</p>

    <p>Judgment is automated.</p>
    <p>Choice is replaced by recommendation.</p>
    <p>Thinking begins on top of defaults.</p>

    <p>That is why we return to the past.</p>

    <p>Every time standards disappeared,</p>
    <p>humans recreated them</p>
    <p>in remarkably similar ways.</p>

    <p>We return</p>
    <p>to see that original pattern.</p>

    <h2>What this series sets out to do</h2>

    <p>This series does not praise great figures.</p>

    <p>Instead, in every episode,</p>
    <p>it holds onto one question:</p>

    <p><em>
      “What did this person choose as their standard,<br />
      and what did they refuse to abandon to the end?”
    </em></p>

    <p>Through their answers,</p>
    <p>we will inevitably ask:</p>

    <p><strong>
      “If it were me,<br />
      what kind of standard would I have created?”
    </strong></p>

      Episode 2. Socrates — The Man Who Rejected the Standard of the Majority
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Socrates</p>
    <p>left behind no books.</p>
    <p>He organized no theories.</p>

    <p>And yet, he became a standard.</p>

    <p>This was no accident.</p>

    <p>What Socrates left behind</p>
    <p>was not answers,</p>
    <p>but a way of creating standards.</p>

    <h2>Why did he say, “I know that I know nothing”?</h2>

    <p>Socrates’ most famous statement is this:</p>

    <p><em>“I know that I know nothing.”</em></p>

    <p>This was not an expression of humility.</p>

    <p>It was a deliberate act of emptying the standard.</p>

    <p>In Athens at the time,</p>
    <p>there were already countless standards.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What the majority believed was right</li>
      <li>The logic of persuasive speakers</li>
      <li>The norms set by those in power</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Socrates asked the same question of all of them:</p>

    <p><em>“Why is that right?”</em></p>

    <h2>Socrates’ standard was not the “correct answer”</h2>

    <p>He did not present correct answers.</p>

    <p>Instead,</p>
    <p>he led others to collapse on their own.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>He questioned the point where they believed they knew</li>
      <li>Let contradictions reveal themselves</li>
      <li>And followed the moment of shaken certainty to the end</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through this process,</p>
    <p>people became uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Because they realized</p>
    <p>that what they had called “their standard”</p>
    <p>was something they had borrowed.</p>

    <h2>Why did he become a dangerous man?</h2>

    <p>Socrates did not threaten political power.</p>
    <p>He did not overthrow institutions.</p>

    <p>And yet, he was executed.</p>

    <p>The reason is simple.</p>

    <p>He continuously destabilized</p>
    <p>the standards of the majority.</p>

    <p>Statements like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Everyone thinks so”</li>
      <li>“That’s just how it is”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>did not work on him.</p>

    <p>He always demanded</p>
    <p>a question one level deeper.</p>

    <h2>The core of the standard Socrates created</h2>

    <p>The standard Socrates left behind</p>
    <p>can be summarized in one sentence:</p>

    <p><strong>
      “What you have examined yourself<br />
      must matter more than what the majority believes.”
    </strong></p>

    <p>For him, a standard was not</p>
    <p>something given from the outside,</p>
    <p>but something inspected from within.</p>

    <h2>Why he left no writings</h2>

    <p>Socrates leaving no writings</p>
    <p>was not accidental.</p>

    <p>Writing turns thought</p>
    <p>into a fixed standard.</p>

    <p>He wanted moving questions,</p>
    <p>not frozen answers.</p>

    <p>The moment a standard is written down,</p>
    <p>it risks becoming dogma.</p>

    <p>Left as a question,</p>
    <p>it remains alive.</p>

    <h2>Socrates’ standard is still uncomfortable today</h2>

    <p>In the age of AI,</p>
    <p>Socrates remains dangerous.</p>

    <p>When we say:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“The AI said so”</li>
      <li>“The data proves it”</li>
      <li>“This is what most people choose”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Socrates asks the same questions:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Why do you think that?”<br />
      “Whose standard is this judgment based on?”
    </em></p>

    <p>That is why</p>
    <p>he is still summoned today.</p>

    <h2>The question Socrates left behind</h2>

    <p>From the perspective of this series,</p>
    <p>the standard Socrates left us is this:</p>

    <p><strong>
      Before following a standard,<br />
      become the one who questions it.
    </strong></p>

    <p>With this single attitude,</p>
    <p>he endured for 2,000 years.</p>

      Episode 3. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} — A Standard That Created Order in Chaos
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If Socrates was the one</p>
    <p>who taught people to doubt existing standards,</p>

    <p>Confucius was the one</p>
    <p>who rebuilt standards</p>
    <p>that could still be used</p>
    <p>after the world had collapsed.</p>

    <p>They may seem like opposites,</p>
    <p>but their attitude toward standards</p>
    <p>is strikingly similar.</p>

    <h2>Why didn’t Confucius create a “new philosophy”?</h2>

    <p>The era Confucius lived in</p>
    <p>was a time of broken order.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The authority of kings was shaken</li>
      <li>Institutions remained only in form</li>
      <li>People no longer knew what was right</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this moment,</p>
    <p>Confucius did not call for revolution.</p>

    <p>He did not invent a radically new theory.</p>

    <p>What he did instead</p>
    <p>was re-align standards that already existed.</p>

    <p>Confucius did not ask:</p>
    <p><em>“What must be new?”</em></p>

    <p>He asked:</p>
    <p><em>“What must remain to the very end?”</em></p>

    <h2>His standard was not emotion, but structure</h2>

    <p>Confucius is often misunderstood</p>
    <p>as a moralist.</p>

    <p>But his core was not a call</p>
    <p>to simply “be good.”</p>

    <p><strong>Ritual (Li)</strong> was not emotion,</p>
    <p>but a structure for behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Humaneness (Ren)</strong> was not sentiment,</p>
    <p>but a standard for relationships.</p>

    <p>Confucius understood something crucial.</p>

    <p>Emotions change.</p>
    <p>Structures can be repeated.</p>

    <p>So his standards did not aim</p>
    <p>at individual virtue,</p>
    <p>but at the minimum conditions</p>
    <p>for society to function again.</p>

    <h2>Why were his standards conservative — and enduring?</h2>

    <p>Confucius is often labeled conservative.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>He valued tradition</li>
      <li>He accepted hierarchy</li>
      <li>He was cautious of radical change</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And yet,</p>
    <p>his standards survived</p>
    <p>for more than 2,000 years.</p>

    <p>The reason is simple.</p>

    <p>Confucius did not design his standards</p>
    <p>for ideal humans,</p>
    <p>but for real ones.</p>

    <p>He assumed imperfection,</p>
    <p>and created standards</p>
    <p>that imperfect humans</p>
    <p>could repeatedly uphold.</p>

    <h2>Why did Confucius choose repetition over questioning?</h2>

    <p>Socrates questioned endlessly.</p>

    <p>Confucius was different.</p>

    <p>He:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Repeated the same teachings</li>
      <li>Emphasized the same rituals</li>
      <li>Demanded the same attitudes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was not a difference in intelligence,</p>
    <p>but a difference in historical need.</p>

    <p>Some eras require questioning.</p>
    <p>Others require fixing standards in place.</p>

    <p>Confucius lived in a time</p>
    <p>when stability mattered more than doubt.</p>

    <h2>Confucius’ standard was not about “choosing what’s right”</h2>

    <p>One important point.</p>

    <p>Confucius’ standard</p>
    <p>does not ask us to choose</p>
    <p>what is right.</p>

    <p>Instead, it asks:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Does this action<br />
      destroy relationships,<br />
      or sustain them?”
    </em></p>

    <p>His standard focused not on outcomes,</p>
    <p>but on sustainability.</p>

    <p>That is why his thought</p>
    <p>is repeatedly recalled</p>
    <p>in politics,</p>
    <p>organizations,</p>
    <p>and education.</p>

    <h2>Why read Confucius again in the age of AI?</h2>

    <p>The age of AI</p>
    <p>is entering another era of disorder.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Judgment is automated</li>
      <li>Responsibility is blurred</li>
      <li>Relationships are reduced to efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this context,</p>
    <p>Confucius seems to say:</p>

    <p><em>
      “No matter how efficient,<br />
      a standard that destroys relationships<br />
      will not last.”
    </em></p>

    <p>The faster technology becomes,</p>
    <p>the more important order grows.</p>

    <h2>The standard Confucius left behind</h2>

    <p>Framed in this series’ question,</p>
    <p>Confucius left us this standard:</p>

    <p><strong>
      A standard is not a blade that cuts right from wrong,<br />
      but a structure that allows people to endure together.
    </strong></p>

    <p>That is why Confucius</p>
    <p>appeared in an age of chaos,</p>
    <p>and is summoned again</p>
    <p>whenever order is needed.</p>

      Episode 4. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} — A Standard That Guarded Against Extremes
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If Socrates</p>
    <p>shook standards through questions,</p>

    <p>and Confucius</p>
    <p>reconstructed order,</p>

    <p>Aristotle stands between them and asks:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Then how far should we go?”
    </em></p>

    <p>His answer is famous,</p>
    <p>yet often misunderstood.</p>

    <p><strong>The Mean (Mesotes).</strong></p>

    <p>Many interpret it as compromise</p>
    <p>or bland moderation.</p>

    <p>But Aristotle’s mean</p>
    <p>means something entirely different.</p>

    <h2>The mean is not the middle — it is the precise point</h2>

    <p>For Aristotle,</p>
    <p>the mean is not half.</p>

    <p>Courage is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Not the midpoint between recklessness and cowardice</li>
      <li>But the exact action required by the situation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Generosity is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Not the average of wastefulness and stinginess</li>
      <li>But a sustainable standard of giving</li>
    </ul>

    <p>He believed this:</p>

    <p>A standard always exists as a single point,</p>
    <p>and that point shifts with context.</p>

    <p>The mean, then,</p>
    <p>is not a lazy choice,</p>
    <p>but the one that demands</p>
    <p>the greatest amount of judgment.</p>

    <h2>Why did Aristotle emphasize situation?</h2>

    <p>Earlier standards tended to rely on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The will of the gods</li>
      <li>Tradition</li>
      <li>The consensus of the majority</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aristotle did not simply follow these.</p>

    <p>He asked:</p>

    <p><em>“Is this right, here and now?”</em></p>

    <p>As a result, his philosophy</p>
    <p>resembles a skill of judgment</p>
    <p>more than a set of abstract commands.</p>

    <p>A standard is not something to memorize.</p>
    <p>It is something to calculate again, every time.</p>

    <h2>Why did he build systems?</h2>

    <p>Aristotle did not stop at asking questions.</p>

    <p>He built frameworks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ethics</li>
      <li>Politics</li>
      <li>Logic</li>
      <li>Natural philosophy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>He systematized standards</p>
    <p>so they could be reused.</p>

    <p>Because a standard that relies only</p>
    <p>on individual intuition</p>
    <p>will eventually collapse again.</p>

    <p>To survive, a standard must be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Teachable</li>
      <li>Repeatable</li>
      <li>Transferable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this sense,</p>
    <p>Aristotle was not only a philosopher,</p>
    <p>but also a designer.</p>

    <h2>Why did his standard endure?</h2>

    <p>Aristotle’s standard was:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Not overly idealistic</li>
      <li>Not purely pragmatic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It assumed:</p>

    <p>Humans are rational,</p>
    <p>yet also imperfect.</p>

    <p>Rules are necessary,</p>
    <p>but rules alone are insufficient.</p>

    <p>This balance</p>
    <p>is what allowed his standard</p>
    <p>to be used for centuries.</p>

    <p>Extremes are easy.</p>
    <p>The mean is difficult.</p>

    <p>That is why</p>
    <p>the mean becomes a standard.</p>

    <h2>Why read Aristotle again in the age of AI?</h2>

    <p>AI favors extremes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maximum efficiency</li>
      <li>Minimum time</li>
      <li>Optimized outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But life</p>
    <p>is rarely that simple.</p>

    <p>Aristotle seems to remind us:</p>

    <p><em>
      “The most efficient choice<br />
      is not always the best one.”
    </em></p>

    <p>In front of AI’s “optimal solution,”</p>
    <p>we must ask again:</p>

    <p><strong>
      “Does this fit the situation right now?”
    </strong></p>

    <p>This question</p>
    <p>is Aristotle’s standard.</p>

    <h2>The standard Aristotle left behind</h2>

    <p>Framed by this series’ question,</p>
    <p>the standard he left is this:</p>

    <p><strong>
      A standard is not a fixed answer decided once,<br />
      but a judgment recalculated for every situation.
    </strong></p>

    <p>That is why his thought</p>
    <p>continues to be used</p>
    <p>in policy,</p>
    <p>organizations,</p>
    <p>ethics,</p>
    <p>and education</p>
    <p>even today.</p>

      Episode 5. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} — The Man Who Became a Standard by Erasing Boundaries
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Socrates left questions.</p>
    <p>Confucius rebuilt order.</p>
    <p>Aristotle designed balance.</p>

    <p>Leonardo da Vinci</p>
    <p>became a standard</p>
    <p>in a completely different way.</p>

    <p>He did not create a standard.</p>
    <p>He erased the boundaries</p>
    <p>that divided standards in the first place.</p>

    <h2>Why didn’t he stay in a single field?</h2>

    <p>We remember Leonardo</p>
    <p>as a painter.</p>

    <p>Or we call him</p>
    <p>an inventor,</p>
    <p>a scientist,</p>
    <p>an anatomist.</p>

    <p>But these labels</p>
    <p>were applied by later generations.</p>

    <p>For Leonardo,</p>
    <p>art and science were not separated.</p>
    <p>Sensation and reason were not divided.</p>
    <p>Observation and imagination did not live apart.</p>

    <p>What mattered to him</p>
    <p>was not the discipline,</p>
    <p>but the phenomenon itself.</p>

    <p>He did not ask:</p>
    <p><em>“Is this an artistic problem or a scientific one?”</em></p>

    <p>He asked:</p>
    <p><em>“How does this work?”</em></p>

    <h2>Leonardo’s standard was observation</h2>

    <p>Leonardo’s countless notebooks</p>
    <p>share a single attitude.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Look first</li>
      <li>Look all the way through</li>
      <li>Verify directly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>He did not accept authority as truth.</p>
    <p>He did not rely on existing theory.</p>

    <p>He dissected bodies</p>
    <p>to understand human anatomy firsthand.</p>

    <p>He drew the flow of water</p>
    <p>to grasp the structure of nature.</p>

    <p>For Leonardo,</p>
    <p>a standard was not found in books,</p>
    <p>but in reality itself.</p>

    <h2>Why he left processes instead of finished answers</h2>

    <p>One fascinating fact:</p>

    <p>Leonardo left behind</p>
    <p>far more unfinished sketches</p>
    <p>than completed works.</p>

    <p>This was not negligence.</p>
    <p>It was intentional.</p>

    <p>He valued</p>
    <p>the trace of thinking in motion</p>
    <p>more than the final result.</p>

    <p>Instinctively, he understood:</p>

    <p>A standard is not</p>
    <p>a completed answer,</p>
    <p>but the way thought moves.</p>

    <h2>Why Leonardo became a standard</h2>

    <p>Leonardo never founded a theory.</p>
    <p>He never created a school.</p>

    <p>And yet,</p>
    <p>he became the standard</p>
    <p>of the “Renaissance human.”</p>

    <p>The reason is clear.</p>

    <p>His way of thinking</p>
    <p>was not bound</p>
    <p>to the problems of a single era.</p>

    <p><strong>Observation → Connection → Reinterpretation</strong></p>

    <p>This structure works</p>
    <p>regardless of time.</p>

    <p>That is why Leonardo</p>
    <p>is a standard for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Scientists</li>
      <li>Artists</li>
      <li>Engineers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why read Leonardo again in the age of AI?</h2>

    <p>AI loves boundaries.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is art</li>
      <li>This is technology</li>
      <li>This is data</li>
      <li>This is emotion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Everything is classified.</p>
    <p>Everything is separated.</p>

    <p>Leonardo stands at the opposite end.</p>

    <p><em>“Question the boundary first.”</em></p>

    <p>In front of AI-generated categories,</p>
    <p>Leonardo seems to ask:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Why must these two things<br />
      be separated at all?”
    </em></p>

    <p>This question</p>
    <p>is becoming more important today.</p>

    <h2>The standard Leonardo left behind</h2>

    <p>Framed by this series’ central question,</p>
    <p>Leonardo left us this standard:</p>

    <p><strong>
      Standards are not created by following classifications,<br />
      but by connecting phenomena.
    </strong></p>

    <p>That is why Leonardo</p>
    <p>remains not the standard of specialists,</p>
    <p>but the standard</p>
    <p>of a thinking human being.</p>

      Episode 6. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} — The Exception Who Broke the Rules and Became the Standard
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If Leonardo da Vinci</p>
    <p>became a standard by erasing boundaries,</p>

    <p>Beethoven became a standard</p>
    <p>by breaking rules.</p>

    <p>But there is one crucial difference.</p>

    <p>Beethoven did not break</p>
    <p>just any rule.</p>

    <p>He broke only the rules</p>
    <p>that could no longer serve as standards.</p>

    <h2>Why did help start as a rebel?</h2>

    <p>Before Beethoven,</p>
    <p>music followed a clear order.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Strict forms</li>
      <li>Predictable structures</li>
      <li>Composers moving within fixed rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Beethoven was not ignorant of this system.</p>
    <p>He understood it better than most.</p>

    <p>That is why he did not ask:</p>
    <p><em>“Should we abolish the rules?”</em></p>

    <p>Instead, he asked:</p>
    <p><em>“Are these rules still alive?”</em></p>

    <h2>Beethoven’s destruction was not chaos</h2>

    <p>To his contemporaries,</p>
    <p>Beethoven’s music felt excessive.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Too long</li>
      <li>Too emotionally exposed</li>
      <li>Too structurally free</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But his destruction always moved in one direction.</p>

    <p>Forms were broken,</p>
    <p>but meaning grew stronger.</p>

    <p>He did not destroy order.</p>
    <p>He elevated the level</p>
    <p>at which order could exist.</p>

    <h2>Why did Beethoven become “classical”?</h2>

    <p>Many artists break rules.</p>
    <p>Most end as deviations.</p>

    <p>Beethoven became a standard</p>
    <p>for three reasons.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Emotion never came before structure</li>
      <li>Destruction was never the goal</li>
      <li>A new order was fully completed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Beethoven did not flee</p>
    <p>after breaking the rules.</p>

    <p>He stayed</p>
    <p>and built new ones in their place.</p>

    <p>That is why he was</p>
    <p>both a revolutionary</p>
    <p>and a classic.</p>

    <h2>Why did he refuse to hide his pain?</h2>

    <p>The strongest force in Beethoven’s music</p>
    <p>is not technique.</p>
    <p>Not structure.</p>

    <p>It is suffering.</p>

    <p>As he lost his hearing,</p>
    <p>he did not aestheticize pain.</p>
    <p>He left discomfort inside the music itself.</p>

    <p>This attitude was dangerous at the time.</p>

    <p>But it is precisely this</p>
    <p>that made him a standard.</p>

    <p>A standard is not built</p>
    <p>from perfection,</p>
    <p>but from traces of endurance.</p>

    <h2>Why read Beethoven again in the age of AI?</h2>

    <p>AI creates</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flawless forms</li>
      <li>Calculated emotion</li>
      <li>Optimized patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Beethoven seems to answer:</p>

    <p><em>
      “The more perfect the form becomes,<br />
      the more meaning can drain away.”
    </em></p>

    <p>In front of AI-generated plausibility,</p>
    <p>Beethoven’s standard becomes sharper.</p>

    <h2>The standard Beethoven left behind</h2>

    <p>Framed by this series’ question,</p>
    <p>Beethoven left us this standard:</p>

    <p><strong>
      Destruction worthy of becoming a standard<br />
      does not tear down order,<br />
      but creates an order that can endure more.
    </strong></p>

    <p>That is why Beethoven</p>
    <p>did not remain an exception,</p>
    <p>but became</p>
    <p>a new classic.</p>

      Episode 7. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} — The Thinker Who Moved the Standard from Outside to Within
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If Beethoven</p>
    <p>broke existing order</p>
    <p>and left new rules behind,</p>

    <p>Nietzsche asked</p>
    <p>a more dangerous question.</p>

    <p><em>“Who decided those rules in the first place?”</em></p>

    <p>Nietzsche did not try to fix standards.</p>
    <p>He relocated them.</p>

    <h2>Why did Nietzsche doubt every standard?</h2>

    <p>Nietzsche lived in an age</p>
    <p>overflowing with standards.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Religion was absolute</li>
      <li>Morality was unquestioned</li>
      <li>Social norms required no explanation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before all of this,</p>
    <p>Nietzsche asked one thing.</p>

    <p><em>
      “Whose life does this standard serve?”
    </em></p>

    <p>He was less concerned with</p>
    <p>whether a standard was right or wrong,</p>

    <p>and more with</p>
    <p>whether it made humans stronger</p>
    <p>or weaker.</p>

    <h2>The real meaning of “God is dead”</h2>

    <p>Nietzsche’s most misunderstood line is:</p>

    <p><strong>“God is dead.”</strong></p>

    <p>This was not a declaration</p>
    <p>against religion.</p>

    <p>His real question was this:</p>

    <p><em>
      “When external standards disappear,<br />
      what will we live by?”
    </em></p>

    <p>Nietzsche understood something crucial.</p>

    <p>When external standards collapse,</p>
    <p>people become free—</p>
    <p>and directionless at the same time.</p>

    <h2>Nietzsche’s standard: inner order</h2>

    <p>Nietzsche did not say,</p>
    <p>“Live however you want.”</p>

    <p>He demanded something far harder.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create your own standard</li>
      <li>Prove it repeatedly through action</li>
      <li>Take full responsibility for the outcome</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The “Übermensch” he spoke of</p>
    <p>was not a superior human,</p>

    <p>but a human capable of</p>
    <p>bearing their own standards.</p>

    <p>Moving standards inward</p>
    <p>is not freedom.</p>

    <p>It is accepting</p>
    <p>total responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Why Nietzsche remains dangerous</h2>

    <p>Nietzsche’s philosophy</p>
    <p>was never meant to be copied.</p>

    <p>In unprepared hands,</p>
    <p>it can slide into nihilism</p>
    <p>or become an excuse</p>
    <p>to reject all standards.</p>

    <p>That is why</p>
    <p>Nietzsche is always dangerous.</p>

    <p>And yet,</p>
    <p>he is always summoned</p>
    <p>when standards collapse.</p>

    <p>When external rules stop working,</p>
    <p>Nietzsche cannot be avoided.</p>

    <h2>Why Nietzsche returns in the age of AI</h2>

    <p>AI represents</p>
    <p>the ultimate external standard.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Data decides</li>
      <li>Systems recommend</li>
      <li>Defaults choose for us</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this era,</p>
    <p>Nietzsche seems to ask:</p>

    <p><em>
      “Can you truly bear<br />
      the standard you’ve handed over?”
    </em></p>

    <p>The moment we surrender standards to AI,</p>
    <p>Nietzsche’s question</p>
    <p>cuts deeper.</p>

    <h2>The standard Nietzsche left behind</h2>

    <p>Framed by this series’ question,</p>
    <p>Nietzsche left us this standard:</p>

    <p><strong>
      A standard loses power<br />
      the moment it is imposed from outside,<br />
      and gains meaning only when<br />
      it is fully borne from within.
    </strong></p>

    <p>That is why Nietzsche remains</p>
    <p>dangerous,</p>
    <p>and why he never disappears.</p>

      Episode 8 (Final). Standards Transcend Time, but the Way We Bear Them Evolves
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This series was not written</p>
    <p>to line up great figures.</p>

    <p>From the beginning,</p>
    <p>we kept asking the same question.</p>

    <p><em>
      “What did this person take as their standard,<br />
      and what did they refuse to give up?”
    </em></p>

    <p>Now it is time</p>
    <p>to gather that question</p>
    <p>into a single flow.</p>

    <h2>Standards survive not as content, but as mechanisms</h2>

    <p>The figures in this series</p>
    <p>lived in completely different eras,</p>
    <p>spoke different languages,</p>
    <p>and faced different problems.</p>

    <p>Yet they share one thing.</p>

    <p>Their standards did not tell people</p>
    <p><em>what</em> to believe.</p>

    <p>Instead, they left behind</p>
    <p><em>how</em> to judge.</p>

    <p>That is why,</p>
    <p>when judgment wavers,</p>
    <p>they are always called back.</p>

    <h2>The flow of those who made standards</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong><br />
        → Doubt the standards of the majority
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong><br />
        → Build order that endures even in chaos
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</strong><br />
        → Seek balance in context, not extremes
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</strong><br />
        → Do not divide boundaries; connect phenomena
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</strong><br />
        → Break old rules, but leave a new order behind
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</strong><br />
        → Move standards from the outside to within
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>They may seem to contradict one another.</p>

    <p>In reality,</p>
    <p>they are repeating the same question</p>
    <p>in the language of different eras.</p>

    <h2>Standards are always born in crisis</h2>

    <p>These figures share the same backdrop.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Existing standards were collapsing</li>
      <li>Majority choices no longer felt correct</li>
      <li>No one could judge on behalf of others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Strikingly,</p>
    <p>we stand in a similar place today.</p>

    <p>Judgment is automated.</p>
    <p>Choice is replaced by recommendation.</p>
    <p>Standards disappear into systems.</p>

    <p>This is why the question of standards</p>
    <p>is not about the past.</p>

    <p>It is a question of now.</p>

    <h2>Why standards return to humans in the age of AI</h2>

    <p>AI excels at</p>
    <p>applying standards.</p>

    <p>But AI does not choose them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What matters most</li>
      <li>What should not be automated</li>
      <li>Who bears responsibility for outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These decisions</p>
    <p>remain human.</p>

    <p>Technology can execute standards,</p>
    <p>but it cannot justify them.</p>

    <h2>Standards move closer to the individual</h2>

    <p>Seen as a whole,</p>
    <p>standards have moved like this:</p>

    <p>
      External authority →<br />
      Social order →<br />
      Judgment as skill →<br />
      Connected thinking →<br />
      Creative destruction →<br />
      Internal responsibility
    </p>

    <p>In other words,</p>
    <p>standards have steadily moved inward.</p>

    <p>The age of AI</p>
    <p>pushes this trajectory to its limit.</p>

    <p>Now the question is no longer,</p>
    <p>“Who said this?”</p>

    <p>It is:</p>

    <p><strong>
      “Can you take responsibility for it?”
    </strong></p>

    <h2>How this series ends</h2>

    <p><em>Those Who Made Standards</em></p>
    <p>is not a tribute to the past.</p>

    <p>It exists to remind us of one thing.</p>

    <p>Standards have always existed.</p>
    <p>What is rare</p>
    <p>is the courage to take them back up.</p>

    <p>In the age of AI,</p>
    <p>what we may need most</p>
    <p>is not a new philosophy,</p>
    <p>but the restoration of</p>
    <p>a stance toward standards.</p>

    <h2>Final sentence</h2>

    <p><strong>
      Standards transcend time.<br />
      What changes is how we carry them.
    </strong></p>

    <p>The final question now belongs to the reader.</p>

    <p><em>
      “Which standard will I choose,<br />
      and how much responsibility can I bear?”
    </em></p>

    <p>The moment you hold on to that question,</p>
    <p>you are no longer</p>
    <p>a consumer of standards.</p>

    <p>You are standing</p>
    <p>on the side that makes them.</p>
